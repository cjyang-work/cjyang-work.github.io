My research focuses on understanding domestication, evolution and breeding from a quantitative genetics perspective. I do a lot of data analysis, genetic mapping, method development and breeding strategy optimization. Statistics and simulation are important components in my work. To date, I have worked on multiple species including maize, teosinte, barley, wheat, tomato, purslane and seaweed.
