Hey there, I am CJ Yang. I am currently a Quantitative Geneticist at Xelect.  

My research includes topics in genetics, breeding, domestication, evolution, statistics and simulations. I do a lot data/genetic analysis, method development and breeding strategy optimization.  

Here is my [CV](https://cjyang-work.github.io/CV_web).
