Hello, I am CJ Yang, currently a postdoc in the [SRUC Principal's Research Group](https://www.sruc.ac.uk/research/research-impact/principal-s-research-group/). The group consists of Wayne Powell, Ian Mackay, Rajiv Sharma, Ian Dawson, David Marshall, Nicola Rossi and me. Please feel free to contact any member of the group for BSc/MSc/PhD research opportunities.  

My current primary research is on crop quantitative genetic analyses using statistics and simulations. My projects are focused on developing novel methodologies for breeding program improvement and management of genetic diversity.  

Here is my [CV](https://cjyang-work.github.io/CV_web).
