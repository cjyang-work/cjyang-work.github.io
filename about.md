Hello, I am CJ Yang, currently a postdoc in the [SRUC Principal's Research Group](https://www.sruc.ac.uk/research/research-impact/principal-s-research-group/). The group currently consists of Wayne Powell, Rajiv Sharma, Nicola Rossi, Emma Irving, Leontien Helderman and me. Please feel free to contact any member of the group for BSc/MSc/PhD research opportunities.  

My current research focus is on plant breeding, quantitative genetics, statistics and simulations. My projects are focused on genetic analysis, method development and strategy optimization for modern plant breeding.  

Here is my [CV](https://cjyang-work.github.io/CV_web).
