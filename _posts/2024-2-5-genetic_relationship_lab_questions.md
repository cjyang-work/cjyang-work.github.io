title: Genetic relationship lab questions

1.	**[Coefficient of coancestry]** Why do we see blocks of patterns in the heatmap? Is there something you can infer from the pedigree?  
2.	**[Coefficient of fraternity]** Can you describe any difference between the heatmaps for coancestry versus fraternity?  
3.	**[Parentage inference]** Can you roughly count the number of recombination events in one RIL?  
4.	**[Additive GRM]** Why are the values in the diagonals larger than the values in the off-diagonals?  
5.	**[Dominance GRM]** Do we need D-GRM in an inbred population, and why?  
6.	**[Compared A/D-GRM to coancestry/fraternity]** Why is there such a large discrepancy between the estimates from pedigree- vs marker-based coefficients?  
7.	**[Additive x additive GRM]** Can you explain why the AA versus A values have a quadratic/U-shaped distribution?  
8.	**[Splitting and combining GRM]** Why is the LOCO-GRM not perfectly correlated to the original GRM?  
9.	**[Fst]** Which (sub)-population is most genetically distant from the overall population, and why?  
10.	**[Genome-wide Fst]** If 0.15 is out cutoff, do we have any significant marker differentiating the two (sub)-populations?  
11.	**[Roger’s/Nei’s distance]** Can you describe any difference or similarity between these two trees?  
12.	**[PCA]** Roughly how many principal components are needed to explain 50% of the variation seen here?  
13.	**[PCA]** Can you describe what are each of the principal components separating?  
14.	**[Population admixture]** Which K do you think is the right one for this dataset?  
15.	**[GWAS]** Can you describe what is the difference in the GWAS results with and without population structure control?
