## Short introduction
Welcome to the homepage for `magicdesign`!

MAGIC (Multiparental Advanced Generation Inter-Cross) is a highly recombined population of multiple founders. MAGIC population is a versatile genetic resource for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, fine-mapping, GxE dissection, genomic prediction, breeding and many more. Please check [this](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-020-0336-6) out for an in-depth review of MAGIC.

:star2: `magicdesign` is an R package devoted to creating and testing MAGIC population designs via simulations. Click [here](https://cjyang-sruc.github.io/magicdesign_vignette) for detailed instructions on installation and usage.

:sparkles: `magicdesignee` is a Shiny app that runs `magicdesign` in its backend. No experience in R is required, all that is needed is [this](https://magicdesign.shinyapps.io/magicdesignee/)!
