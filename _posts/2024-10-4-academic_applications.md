title: Applications for academic positions 
---

I have applied to about 20 faculty positions in US colleges and I have reached the final interview stage 4 times. In case my application materials can be of some use to you, please feel free to check them out in the links below. In most cases, you will need to submit a cover letter, CV, research statement, teaching statement and diversity-equity-inclusion statement. Anyway, I have clearly not been successful in my attempts and I have now given up on trying again so please take whatever you think is suitable from my applications - and it is always good to keep your own flavor when writing your applications. :smiley:
