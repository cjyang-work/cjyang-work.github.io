1.	**[Background]** Why do we need to study genetic relationship?  
    + Understanding of selection, adaptation, ecology and evolution.
    + Gene mapping.
    + Quantitative genetics and complex traits.
    + Method development.
    + Genetic diversity management, optimal parental selection.
    + Target environment breeding.
    + Marker-based mapping and selection.
2.	**[IBD]** What is identity-by-descent?  
    + Two alleles that have originated from the replication of one single allele in a previous generation.
    + Two alleles of the same origin.
3.	**[IBD]** Can you describe an application of IBD?  
    + QTL linkage mapping
    + Marker genotype imputation and phasing
    + Genetic relationship matrix (GRM) calculation
    + Breeding and evolutionary history understanding
    + Population demographic inference
    + Genealogy and ancestry identification
    + Forensics
4.	**[IBS]** What is identity-by-state?  
    + Two of the same alleles regardless of their ancestral origins.
    + Two alleles of the same state.
5.	**[IBS]** Can you describe an application of IBS?  
    + Genetic relationship matrix (GRM) calculation
    + Linkage disequilibrium identification
    + Association mapping
6.	**[Genetic distance]** What is genetic distance?  
    + A measure of genetic divergence between populations or sub-populations.
7.	**[Genetic distance]** What are the causes of genetic divergence?  
    + Selection
    + Mutation
    + Drift
8.	**[Genetic distance]** Can you describe a method to compute genetic distance?  
    + Roger's distance
    + Nei's distance
    + Fst/Qst

    + Identifying the impact of selection and breeding.
    + Understanding evolution from a population genetics angle.
    + Phylogenetics.
    + Data encryption.
10.	**[Population structure]** What is population structure?  
    + A consequence of genetic divergence between sub-populations.
11.	**[Population structure]** Can you describe a method for controlling the effect of population structure in genetic mapping?  
    + Structured association, Q+K.
    + Genomic/delta control.
    + Stepwise regression.
    + Machine learning.
    + Functional validation.
    + Replication studies.
    + Family-based test, e.g. TDT, linkage mapping
